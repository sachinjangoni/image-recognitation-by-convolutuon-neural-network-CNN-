# image-recognitation-by-convolutuon-neural-network-CNN-
# About dataset
    The dataset as thousands of dog and cat images
# Task
  We will implement convolution neural network (CNN) model to recognize whethear the image is cat or dog.
# Plan :
   # Convolution operations
   # Rectifier function(ReLu layer)
   # pooling
   # Flattening
   # input layers are image of cat or dog
   # Stocastic gradient descent for minimizing cost function
# Evaluation
   Model evaluation based on accuracy score.
